#Introduction


tool to visually create screen and process maps. It is a kind of a low/no code project

I will get around to the documentation at some point, if there is enough
interest in the project.

Any issues can be mailed to me: faghmie@gmail.com

I needed some sort of diagram tool which I could easily generate my SQL
from and also play with the data in the tables to get a feel for how
effective my ERD is.


I hope you find the project usefull :-)


This software is based on the original code of www sql designer 
(http://ondras.zarovi.cz/sql/demo/)


# General
-------

You can use the program to create some basic ERD's with it.
You can then edit the data in the tables.

# Foreign keys
------------
Simply drag-and-drop the field from the first table into the header
of the second table you want to link to.

# Web-App
-------
This is a basic attempt to create a very basic application from your ERD


# Documentation
-------------
Using your ERD the system will attempt to create some basic 
documentation.

** I still need to make it exportable to HTML. :-)


# Import - CSV
------------

The system can import a CSV file and auto-create the table with its data.
